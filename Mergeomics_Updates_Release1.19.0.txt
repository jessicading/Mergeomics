KDA visualization (kda2cytoscape)
	Fix some KDs being mislabeled as ‘Ellipse’ not ‘Diamond’
	Add border color to KDs representing the top module that it regulates
	Lighten default colors
	Nodes colored not only by select modules (was only being colored by the module that the top KDs per module were regulators of)
	Add original weight of input network to cytoscape edges file

KDA analysis (kda.analyze)
	Circumvent ks.test error that occurs in large KDAs
	
Module merging (ssea2kda)
	Add back genes that were lost from merging modules
	Fix case with no shared genes (tool.coalesce)

MSEA for non-GWAS (ssea.start)
	If user does not provide the genfile (mapping file), then assume the run is non-GWAS (eg., TWAS, PWAS) and create “fake” mapping file and set appropriate parameters

Meta (ssea.finish.fdr)
	Output summary of significance values across all studies

MSEA to KDA (ssea2kda)
	Handling of one or two modules passed to KDA
	Take out control gene sets
